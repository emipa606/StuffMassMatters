  <SMM.AffectMovementSpeedFactorsTT>If an item also has a negative movement-speed factor, this will be changed based on the relative weight of the stuff its made of. So a uranium platearmor has a much higher movement-speed penalty than a plasteel armor. Only negative factors are affected, since positive values assumes power armor or similar that is not affected by weight.</SMM.AffectMovementSpeedFactorsTT>

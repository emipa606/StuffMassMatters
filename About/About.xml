Always found it strange that different "stuff" has different mass but things made with it always has the same mass.
So this mod just modifies the mass of items depending on what stuff they are made of.
No longer is a Uranium plate armor as easy to carry as one made of Bamboo and pawns with plasteel equipment can carry more on their caravan adventures.

The mod looks at the stuffcategories that an item can be made of and uses the stuff with the highest commonality value as a basevalue.
It then calculates the relative mass based on the stuff the item is made of.
Affects all items that can be made from different "stuff", mostly apparel but some weapons and buildings as well.

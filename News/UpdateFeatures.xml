    <content>There is now an additional effect to this mod (can be disabled in the settings).
Items that has a negative movement speed factor, like plate armor, will not have the stuff-weight affect this as well.
So for example a Uranium plate armor will have a lot higher movement speed penalty than an armor made of plasteel.</content>
